lesson 3 reflections here.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks:they are used to clone repositories between two github accounts.

clones:they are used to clone from server to local machine and vice versa.

branches:they are used to add temporary changes before permanently adding it to official code.
